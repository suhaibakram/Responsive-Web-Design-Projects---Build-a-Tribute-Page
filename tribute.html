              <ul id="line-list">
                <li><h2 id="bold-head">"I’m Chandler; I Make Jokes When I’m Uncomfortable."</h2>In season six episode “The One with the Proposal: Part 1”, Chandler and Monica run into Richard and his date just when Chandler was about to propose. Monica points out that Richard’s mustache is back and Chandler, feeling uncomfortable, jokes about Richard’s date not having a mustache. Realizing his joke fell flat, and feeling increasingly awkward, Chandler follows it up with this hilarious introduction.</li><br>
                <li><h2 id="bold-head">"Hey, Come On, I Say More Dumb Things Before 9 A.M. Than Most People Say All Day."</h2>The season four episode “The One with the Fake Party” opens with a pregnant Phoebe looking around Monica’s kitchen in search of something she wants to eat. In her frustration, Phoebe knocks over a box of cereal, prompting Chandler to make the obligatory pun by referring to her as a cereal killer. Monica mocks him, but Chandler brushes it off with a self-reflective and relatable reply</li><br>
                <li><h2 id="bold-head">"Well, Maybe He Was Nervous."</h2>Some of Chandler’s best one-liners were the ones that weren’t on-the-nose, like this gem from season two episode “The One Where Ross and Rachel… You Know”. In this scene, the group is hanging out at Joey and Chandler’s and Ross is on the phone with someone from the museum.</li><br>
                <li><h2 id="bold-head">"I'm Not Great At The Advice... Can I Interest You In A Sarcastic Comment?"</h2>In season eight episode “The One with the Tea Leaves”, a desperate Rachel vents to Chandler about being afraid of losing Joey as a friend now that he's admitted to having feelings for her. Chandler listens to her, but once it’s his turn to actually say something useful he admits he might not be of much use to her in the most Chandler way possible.</li><br>
                <li><h2 id="bold-head">"Okay, You Have To Stop The Q-Tip When There Is Resistance."</h2>When Joey can’t remember how old he was in 1990, Chandler delivers the ultimate sarcastic insult by reminding his friend of this important health hazard. It’s Matthew Perry’s favorite line and a classic and timeless Chandler zinger.</li>

<!-- <p>Chandler is introduced as a sarcastic person with a heightened fear of commitment. He lives with his roommate Joey next to Monica's apartment and constantly makes fun of Joey. He finds himself stumbling across the same annoying woman Janice who he has to break up with thrice in a span of one year.</p>
<p>Chandler is extremely furious when Monica tells the rest of the group about his third nipple. He once accepts Monica's help to lose weight but gets annoyed when she wakes him up on a Sunday and playfully calls him "fat boy"</p>
<p>Chandler being in a passionate relationship with Janice. This is the only time where he doesn't intend to break up with her, and is genuinely in love with her and can overlook her seemingly annoying voice and laugh</p>
<p>This starts with a perplexed Chandler questioning why Monica would never hypothetically date him. At the beach, Monica gets stung by a jellyfish and Joey remembers that the pain can be mediated if someone pees on it.</p>
<p>He has relatively low emotional stability because of his mother’s and father’s occupations. (His mother is an erotic novelist and his father is a cross-dresser in Las Vegas.) His parents have left him emotionally scarred and immature when it comes to developing his own relationships. (They told him they were getting divorced on Thanksgiving…) When nervous in social situations, Chandler turns to humour to avoid dealing with real emotions because he is so insecure.</p> -->
